Pure Functions

- For a valid input, there's one and only one valid output.
- Don't modify variables out of their scope.
- no side effects


Advantages
- consistent reproducible result independent of the environment
- Easier parallelization ((no shared data)
- memozation or caching
- laziness
- REFERENTIAL TRANSPARENCY

REFERENTIAL TRANSPARENCY
 - used to guage the purity of functions
 - two functions can be substituted for each other.
 


#Pure Functions

// state of the passed object is modified
function impure(str: String) {
    str = str+ "POST"
    print(str)
    return str
}

// state of the passed object is not modified
function pure(str: String) {
    return str + "POST"
}
