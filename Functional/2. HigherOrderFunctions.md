Higher Order Functions / First class citizens

Higher order functions are functions which accept function as argument and can return function

- Functions are first class data, like literals and objects
- Functions can take other functions as arguments
- Functions can return a function as result
- Man advantage is partial application of function


# Functions - first class citizens

var f = function(num :Int) {
    num %2 == 0
}

f(4)
var v = f(3)
