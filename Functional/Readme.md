In this paradigm we express computations as the evaluation of mathematical functions.

## Functional Programming by Wikipidia:
“Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data”. In other words, functional programming promotes code with no side effects, no change of value in variables. It oposes to imperative programming, which enfatizes change of state”.


Functional Programming in the process of building software by using pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data and side-effects.


## Definition of Functional Programming
- Programming with functions as building blocks
- Programming with pure functions as building blocks
- Functional programming is programming without assignment statements

## Lambda calculus 
- fundamentals of functional programming


## Convert programs to lambda and vice versa

## Jargons of Functional Programming
- Higher order functions
- Pure functions
- Type strictness
- Recursion
- Immutability
- Category Theory
- Lambda calculus
- Currying


Core idea of Functional programming  - NO SIDE EFFECTS




Expression vs Statement
- Expression have no side effect
- checks conditions and returns value
- Statement have side effects
- contains assignments


#PSEUDO CODE:
#Statement
Int weight = 50 //kg
String comment = ""
if (x > 70) {
    comment = "Slim down, bro"
}else {
    comment = "you look fit"
}

#Expression
Int weight = 50 //kg
String comment = x>70? "Slim down, bro" : "You look fit!"
