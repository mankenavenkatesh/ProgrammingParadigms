In this paradigm we express computations as the evaluation of mathematical functions.

## Functional Programming by Wikipidia:
“Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data”. In other words, functional programming promotes code with no side effects, no change of value in variables. It oposes to imperative programming, which enfatizes change of state”.


Functional Programming in the process of building software by using pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data and side-effects.
