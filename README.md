# ProgrammingParadigms
This repo is about becoming language agnoistic. -Should understand different programming paradigms and think programming languages in terms of paradigms

- This repo is concerned with the study of programming language paradigms , that is the various systems of ideas that have been used to guide the design of programming languages. 
- These paradigms are realised to a greater or lesser extent in various computer languages, although the design of a given language may reflect the influence of more than one paradigm.
- The paradigms are not exclusive, but reflect the different emphasis of language designers. Most practical imperative, functional and object-oriented languages embody features of more than one paradigm.

## What are different Programming Paradigms?
- The Functional Paradigm
- The Imperative Paradigm
- The Logic Paradigm
- The Object-Oriented Paradigm
- The Scheme Language

### Approach
- This repo contains folders for every paradigm.
- Every folder explains about the paradigm in detail with examples.
- Every folder contains references to - how this paradigm is used in different programming languages.
