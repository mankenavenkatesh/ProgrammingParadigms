# ProgrammingParadigms
This repo is about becoming language agnoistic. -Should understand different programming paradigms and implement them

What are Programming Paradigms?
The Functional Paradigm

The Imperative Paradigm

The Logic Paradigm

The Object-Oriented Paradigm

The Scheme Language

This repo is concerned with the study of programming language paradigms , that is the various systems of ideas that have been used to guide the design of programming languages. These paradigms are realised to a greater or lesser extent in various computer languages, although the design of a given language may reflect the influence of more than one paradigm.

Imperative: The language provides statements, such as assignment statements , which explicitly change the state of the memory of the computer.
Functional: In this paradigm we express computations as the evaluation of mathematical functions.
Logic: In this paradigm we express computation in exclusively in terms of mathematical logic
Object-Oriented: In this paradigm we associate behaviour with data-structures called " objects " which belong to classes which are usually structured into a hierarchy.
The paradigms are not exclusive, but reflect the different emphasis of language designers. Most practical imperative, functional and object-oriented languages embody features of more than one paradigm.
